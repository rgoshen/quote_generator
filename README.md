# Quote Generator

This is a small project I created during my self-taught days to practice JavaScript. The Quote Generator dynamically displays random quotes with each click, offering a straightforward example of DOM manipulation and asynchronous data handling in JavaScript.

## Features

- Generates a new quote each time the button is clicked.
- Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- Demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and event handling.

## How It Works

The app fetches quotes from an array or external API, then updates the displayed quote in the UI. It’s a simple, interactive project that helped me strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rgoshen/quote_generator.git
```

2. Open index.html in your browser to view the app.

## Usage

Click the “Generate Quote” button to display a new random quote.
